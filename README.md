# Automatic-3D-Segmentation-of-Liver-Blood-Vessels-Using-Deep-Learning
Automatic 3D Segmentation of Liver Blood Vessels Using Deep Learning.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The GUI was built using tkinter & pyinstaller. 
Anyone can download and use our "Automatic 3D Segmentation of Liver Blood Vessels Using Deep Learning"
wihout having to download Python or anything extra.
The GUI is meant to be the practical application of this research and is targeted towards medical experts, researches and individuals without prior knowledge in coding.

### To Download & Use our GUI, simply follow these steps:

1. Download the GUI from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLbyea3n-ieCANECwmgbBwggMXTYckhc/view?usp=sharing
2. Extract the zipped folder.
